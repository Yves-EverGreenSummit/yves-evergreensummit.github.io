"Yves Deutschmann, founder of Evergreen Summit Data Solutions, played a key role in creating a system that integrates FACTONâ€™s Cost Management software with their Business Case Simulator for TI Fluid Systems. This solution enables us to efficiently analyze and simulate the financial impact of changes across entire projects, significantly improving our ability to evaluate profitability and make data-driven decisions. 

Yves not only implemented a technical solution but also understood our business needs and delivered a system that perfectly aligns with our requirements. His expertise, innovative approach, and dedication to excellence have made a tangible impact on our processes. I highly recommend Yves and his company for their outstanding service and technical skills."
